This program is a simple, fun program for people who just want an example of some simple python code. Please keep in mind that this is my first actual repository, so please don't be harsh if things should be done differently. Just open an issue and possibly ask to be a contributor.

The code asks for your name and your age. This information is not stored anywhere and is only client side which means it only exists when you run the program after you enter it. It also asks for a scale of 1 to 10 of how you are feeling.
